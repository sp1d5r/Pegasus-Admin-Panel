## Pegasus Education 

Pegasus education is my approach to free education for students at GCSE and A-Level. This is an app available for iOS 
and android devices. This admin panel is the react web app our developers use to create the custom courses for our students


### What makes this special?
Pegasus educations works on a similar approach as ANKI flashcards, don't relearn topics you've covered before. Have 
confidence that you are only learning topics you need to go over.

### Want to help make courses?
We could use all the help possible, since we are trying to make Pegasus education free and available for everyone. If 
you're looking for a job opportunity and are a student please get in contact with me and I'll be more than happy to try 
and get you involved.
